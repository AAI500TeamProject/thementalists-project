It’s a confirmed error (e.g., typo, sensor glitch)

It violates assumptions required by your analysis

It distorts results disproportionately

It's not part of the target population (e.g., test done under wrong condition)

Keep the outlier if:

It’s a valid extreme case

You’re interested in natural variation

It reveals important subgroups or rare behavior
